  Uses "$INSTALL -d" for creating directory hierarchies, so disable
  use of -p in $INSTALL since -p and -d are mutually exclusive.

DescDetail: <<
VIGRA stands for "Vision with Generic Algorithms". It's a novel computer
vision library that puts its main emphasize on customizable algorithms
and data structures. By using template techniques similar to those in
the C++  Standard Template Library, you can easily adapt any VIGRA
component to the needs of your application, without thereby giving up
execution speed.

DescPackaging: <<
  Shared libraries disabled until they update their libtool.
  If anyone wants to figure out the libtool fix for this one, feel free,
  its a monster - they used an old alpha CXX libtool branch.
