% location.dat file for az_proj
%
% allows entering of QTH lat/lon co-ordinates from external devices 
% such as GPS receivers, rather than having to enter the data
% into az_ini.ps with an editor. 
% This feature was suggested by Paul N1BWT for use by moutain toppers.
%
% The file consists of any number of lines of any sort of data in any format
% (such as NMEA codes from the GPS receiver on the serial port, giving
% lat, lon, altitude, time) 
% followed by suitable postscript routines to parse the data into 
% az_proj variables. 
% In this version of the file, two reals (lat, lon) are entered 
% (pushed on the stack in Postscript speak) then they are popped off
% the stack into the variables lon_QTH, lat_QTH.
%
% When I find out the real NMEA specs I will rewrite the routines to
% parse the NMEA codes.
% For those of you who have azimuth indicators, wind speed and 
% direction indicators, thermometers, hygrometers, etc, hooked
% up to your computer, so that they can output a line of data to 
% a file, then presumably this information can be drawn with az_proj as well.
%
% method of use:
% a) turn /use_automatic_option "off" (in az_ini.ps). 
% This prevents the "option" routines in az_proj.ps from 
% overwriting the values of the variables calculated here.
% b) use a command line like
%
% C:\gs261>gs az_ini.ps location.dat -- az_proj.ps n_amer.wdb mountain.dat rover.dat > error.out
%
% the routines in the location.dat file overwrite the QTH data declared
% in az_ini.ps. You can add anything at all in this file to change the
% values of previously declared values - it doesn't have to be just
% location information.
%
% the file consists of 2 parts
% 1 - NMEA codes, giving lat/lon, speed, altitude, time etc info.
% Presumably this information will come via some utility program
% which will be run as part of a batch file which runs az_proj.
%
% Here's a mockup of the NEMA information, from the hypothetical utility.
%
42.0	%latitude of QTH
-75.0	%longitude of QTH
%
% 2 - routines to parse the NMEA coded information
%
/lon_QTH exch def
/lat_QTH exch def
% end
