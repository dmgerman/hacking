%Repeater File for az_proj v1.04
%
%t--------------------------------------
%
% This file is readable by AZ_PROJ v1.04 (or greater)
%
% Each line in this file represents a transmitter.
% The file format was devised for AZ_PROJ, a program which draws maps
% for amateur radio operators. A line of this file will be plotted
% by AZ_PROJ as a symbol on a map.
%
% It is hoped that this machine readable transmitter file
% format is a generally useful format for beacons, repeaters, rovers,
% TV stations, FM stations, AM broadcast stations, airport radars ...),
% for people who maintain and use databases for transmitters.
%
% The line format for transmitters and it's specifications
% are hereby released into the public domain.
% Suggestions for changes in the format are welcome.

%	To add a transmitter to the file, supply data in the form
%		transmitter_type:frequency:string_1(suggested use, callsign):6 character grid_locator:power(W):beam_heading(s):string_2(suggested use, location or special operating condx):comment ignored by reading program (eg AZ_PROJ)
%	eg 2m beacon
%		beacon:144.170:NA3T:FM19gk:60:300:Frederick, MD: Joe, ph# 301-555-1212, 5dbd yagi, from W3EP, Oct 96
%	eg. rover operating a weekend 10GHz contest from Mt Ascutney
%		rover:10:NA3T:FN33sk:::only saturday: 2m link is 147.54, cell ph# 860-555-1212
% 	eg TV station North America channel 2, used as a 6m propagation marker
%		TV:55.25Z:WPBT/02:FL05cx:100000:-1:Miami,FL,US:comment
%
%	transmitter_type is
%		beacon
%		repeater
%		rover
%		TV
%		BC			%usually 550-1630 kHz AM
%		AM			%usually 550-1630 kHz AM
%		FM             %North America is 88-108MHz
%
%		beacon and repeater is plotted as a nested set of circles
%		(or if directional, a fan 70 deg wide).
%		The number of circles indicate the power level.
%		Rover is plotted as a VW beetle.
%		Power and beam_heading info info are ignored.
%		High power commercial stations used as propagation markers or
%		for mad DX hunters (TV, AM, FM, ...) are not differentiated
%		by AZ_PROJ (at least yet). They can be plotted as either
%		a non-directional tower (one section for each factor of 10
%		increase in power) or by nested circles (see az_ini.ps).
%
%	frequency is
%		int or a real. The units are not specified here and
%		instead are known by the program using the file.
%		Units could be	kHz, MHz, GHz, wavelength in m, channel number...
%
%		In AZ_PROJ the frequency entry is matched with entries in the
%		array /bands_plotted. If a match is found the entry is plotted
%		on the map, otherwise the entry is skipped. If the entry is a real
%		eg 55.25, then the int resulting from truncation (in this case 55)
%		is matched against the entries in /bands_plotted. If a real
%		the last digit in the frequency can instead be an arbitrary char
%		which is plotted on the map (eg 55.250H for horizontal polarisation).
%		Some chars have special meaning eg +,-,N,Z for TV stations
%		(see file TVxxx.dat for further details), or +/- for repeaters
%		(see file repxxx.dat for further details).
%
%	power
%		if -1, then power unknown. Will be plotted as minimal power
%		(set in az_proj.ps).
%
%	beam_heading is
%		1. -1 if omnidirectional
%		2. int (0..360) if one main lobe is radiated
%		or
%		3. comma separated list of int eg 60,180,300 if multilobed radiator
%		or 45,225 if dipole facing NE/SW
%
%		It is also possible to draw a multilobed radiator by putting
%		several lines identical except for the beam_heading.
%
%
% File Names:
%		AZ_PROJ uses 8.3 DOS file names for transmitter files.
%		The extension is .dat
%		Where possible, the file name is
% 		transmitter_type - country/location - subclass
%		eg tv_nach2.dat for TV stations in North America on channel 2
%		eg bea_na.dat for all VHF beacons in North America
%
%
% New Transmitter Types:
%		It is relatively easily to add code for new transmitter types
%		to AZ_PROJ. If a map was needed of Automatic Packet Reporting
%		System (APRS) nodes in a meteor scatter event or of packet stations,
%		in a traffic network, then I would only need a list of APRS
%		nodes and a few suggestions for a symbol.

%
%Special Notes for Repeater files:
%	A repeater file has the same format as a beacon file,
%	except that the lines start with repeater:
%	and "+/-" are allowed in the repeater frequency string.
%
%	The ARRL is not allowed to release the contents of
%	their repeater directory, because of a non-release
%	clause required by most repeater coordinators
%	before parting with their valuable lists. Apparently
%	the callsign and frequency of repeaters is regarded
%	as valuable and proprietary by many people. If you
%	are able to pry your local repeater coordinator's fingers
%	off his list then you can put repeaters on your own map.
