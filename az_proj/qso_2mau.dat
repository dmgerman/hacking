% draws great circle line between two stations,
% neither of which is at the center of the map.
% useful for plotting contacts after a big opening
% when qso data from many pairs of stations can be plotted.
% Eg following an Es, Au, or high pressure tropo opening.

% qso: data type for line, modifier which draws the grid square of the qth (see below)
% 144: band in /bands_plotted format (int, real, see az_ini.ps)
% NA3T: callsign of first station (optional, null otherwise)
% IO51: 4 char grid locator of first station (_not_ 6char)
% NV3Z: callsign of second station (optional, null otherwise)
% FN00: 4 char grid locator of second station (_not_ 6char)
% comment field (anything you like).

% Grid Square emphasis:
% The original code for the "qso:" data type drew the great circle
% path between the centers of the grid squares at each end of the path.
% With v1.04 it is also possible to fill/hatch the grid square at
% one or both ends of the path for additional emphasis.
% You might want to fill the grid square if one station 
% contacts many stations.
% You also might just like grid squares drawn at each 
% end just because you like it.
%
% To turn on the drawing of grid squares -
% If the first letter of the grid locator is upper case (eg IO51),
% then the grid square will be drawn, using the data_modifier to
% fill/shade/hatch the grid square.
% If the first letter of the grid locate is lower case (eg iO51 or io51)
% then the grid square will _not_ be drawn and the qso path with just be
% a line, of color qso_color (set in az_ini.ps).
%
% Note you may have to be careful in the order you plot your
% qso paths. Solid filled (colored) grid squares will draw
% over previously drawn parts of the map.
