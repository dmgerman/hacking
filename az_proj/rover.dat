%Rover file for az_proj v1.00-1.03:
%
%Rovers are located by 6 character grid square locators,
%which run from AA00aa to RR99xx.
%The Rover symbol is put at the center of that square,
%giving an error (at the equator) in positioning of less
%than 2km in the E-W direction and less than 2km in the N-S direction.
%If greater accuracy is required, then the general purpose
%annot.dat file can provide locations to an arbitrary accuracy.
%
%The rover.dat format is the standard transmitter type,
%with a VW beetle as the symbol
%transmitter power and beamheading are ignored.
%The band/freq must match with /bands_plotted in az_ini.ps or the line will be ignored.
%
%
%To add a rover to the map, supply data in the form
%
%rover:freq (number):string_1(sugest callsign):grid_locator:power(-1 for default):beam heading(-1 for default);string_2:comment ignored by AZ_PROJ
%
%where
%rover    - data type
%freq	- number (eg 10 can be 10m, 10MHz, 10cm, 10GHz, see /bands_plotted in az_ini.ps)
%string_1 - any or null string (blanks OK), will be written on left of rover symbol
%                possible use - call sign
%string_2 - any or null string (blanks OK), will be written on right of rover symbol
%                possible use - name of location
%power/beam_heading are ignored for rover - use -1
%comment  - ignored by AZ_PROJ, for your own purposes
%
%
%Note: So that a rover can be plotted as being on a mountain,
%the mountain strings are drawn above and below the mountain symbol,
%while the rover strings are to the left and right.
