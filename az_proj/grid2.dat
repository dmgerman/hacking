% File grid2.dat
% grid2.dat formatted data file for az_proj v1.02
% (C) Joseph Mack (C) 1996
%
% You need AZ_PROJv1.02, or later, to run a "grid2" file
%
% contains grids worked (4 character notation) by freq and propagation mode.
% grid squares go from AA00 to RR99.
% the "grid2" format of AZ_PROJv1.02 is designed to supercede the "grid" format of v1.0
%
% The band to be displayed is selected in
% the array "/bands_plotted" in az_ini.ps
% the grid worked will be colored/marked according to the propagation mode used.
% the propagation modes are primarily of interest to VHF'ers
% The equivelent type of file for HF'ers would be the dxcc.dat file
% where contacts with dxcc countries are plotted by band and mode (CW, ssb...)
%
% a typical grid2.dat line is
% grid2:50:F2:FM19:comment field
% where -
% grid2: symbol to show that following data is a worked grid
% 50: band the grid was worked on
% F2: propagation mode, F2, Es, EME, Au, Ms, TEP, or unknown ()
% FM19 grid worked
% comment field of anything at all (ignored for plotting)
%
% Ms and Au occupy the same space and an Es contact will overwrite an Au contact.
% The reverse is not true. The Au symbol does not overwrite the Es color patch.
% For any grid, list the Au contact after the Es contact.
% White space is not allowed in the active fields.
%
% This file can be used with a command like
% gs -q az_ini.ps vhf_conf.ps -- az_proj.ps n_amer.wdb grid2.dat
