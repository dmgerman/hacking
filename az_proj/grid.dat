% File grid.dat
% grid.dat formatted data file for az_proj v1.04
% (C) Joseph Mack (C) 1996
%
% You need AZ_PROJ v1.04, or later, to run a this file
% The format here is the "grid2" format of v1.03
% The "grid" format of v1.00 is no longer used
%
% contains grids worked (4 character notation) by freq and propagation mode.
% grid squares go from AA00 to RR99.
% the "grid2" format of AZ_PROJv1.02 is designed
% to supercede the "grid" format of v1.0
%
% The band to be displayed is selected in
% the array "/bands_plotted" in az_ini.ps
% the grid worked will be colored/marked according to the propagation mode used.
% the propagation modes are primarily of interest to VHF'ers
% The equivelent type of file for HF'ers would be the dxcc.dat file
% where contacts with dxcc countries are plotted by band and mode (CW, ssb...)
%
% Note about data_modifiers
% From v1.04 onwards, data_modifiers can be used to modify grid: and qso: lines
% (data_modifiers are allowed on all lines but will be ignored on all other data types).
% The purposed of this is to allow worked grid squares (or qso's)
% of several different appearances on the same page.
% Thus it is possible to mark the grid squares (or qso's) from
% one station differently than squares worked from other station(s).
% In earlier verions of AZ_PROJ it was possible to have two alternate
% markings by using a grid: or a GRID: data type (giving two types
% of marked grid squares). This was not a particularly extensible
% scheme and and the data type (grid: or GRID:) gives no indication
% of the appearance of the square.
%
% A normal worked grid square line starts
% grid:
% and gives a square filled with the color /worked_grid_square_color
% (set in az_ini.ps, currently set to verylightblue)
%
% data_modifiers which fill grid squares
% Note these colors fill the square and will obliterate a previously
% drawn square (in the same place) worked by someone else.
% Any previously drawn features will also be obliterated.
% Thus grid squares drawn with these data_modifiers will
% have to be read in before the .wdb files.
%
% grid-red: grid is filled with the color /grid-red_color
% grid-green: grid is filled with the color /grid-green_color
% grid-blue: grid is filled with the color /grid-blue_color
%
%
% data_modifiers which do not fill grid squares.
% These are all B&W (could be changed of course in az_ini.ps)
% and hence are suitable for B&W printers.
%
% These data_modifiers draw sets of lines in the worked grid square.
% Lines do not obliterate previous markings on the map (well you
% can read between the lines).
% Grid squares drawn with these data_modifiers can be read in
% after the .wdb files.
% The spacing of the lines is adjusted to give about the same
% density of lines, no matter the shape of the box (aspect
% varies from equator to poles) or the scale
% It is possible to mark a particular square as being worked
% by two different people.
%
% This pair allow marking by two different orthogonal sets of lines
% grid-lon: grid is crossed with lines parallel to the longitude lines
% grid-lat: grid is crossed with lines parallel to the latitude lines
% Note in the azimuthal equidistant projection, the lat lines are
% not parallel and the lon lines are not parallel. Thus two well
% separated grid squares both marked by e.g -lon (or instead by -lat)
% will not neccessarily be seen by the eye to be related.
%
% Another orthogonal pair (also see comments for grid-lon and grid-lat)
% grid-left: grid is crossed by lines running NW to SE (i.e. lines leaning left)
% grid-right: grid is crossed by lines running NE to SW (i.e. lines leaning right)
%
% Another orthogonal pair
% grid-horz: grid is crossed by lines running horizontally in page space
% grid-vert: grid is crossed by lines running vertically in page space
% Note well separated grid squares with these data_modifiers will have
% parallel lines and will appear to the eye to be related.
%
% An now for something completely different
% grid-*: grid is crossed by lines radiating from the QTH
% (ie the point at the center of the projection).
% Note, at a distance of about more than 4 grid squares from the QTH
% all lines within a worked grid appear parallel.
% If many squares are worked by one station, then the
% markings in all worked grid squares will radiate from one point.
% Note this routine is very slow compared to the other methods of marking grid squares
% It has to calculate radial lines for the whole page.
%
%
% a typical grid.dat line is
% grid-modifier:50:F2:FM19:comment field
% where -
% grid: symbol to show that following data is a worked grid
% modifier: see above explanation
% 50: band the grid was worked on
% F2: propagation mode, F2, Es, EME, Au, Ms, TEP, or unknown ()
% FM19 grid worked
% comment field of anything at all (ignored for plotting)
%
% Ms and Au occupy the same space and an Es contact will overwrite an Au contact.
% The reverse is not true. The Au symbol does not overwrite the Es color patch.
% For any grid, list the Au contact after the Es contact.
% White space is not allowed in the active fields.
%
% To show this file, set the center to ARRL HQ, scale to 100km/cm and run
% gs -q az_ini.ps -- az_proj.ps grid.dat
