%Controld.ps (C) Joseph Mack NA3T and Michael Katzman NV3Z, 1996
% This file contains the ^D (the \004 or unix EOF) character
%
% Summary: concatenate controld.ps at the end of your Postscript files, 
% when sending to a real Postscript printer.
%
% Explanation: A postscript file, when sent to a real Postscript printer
% must be terminated by ^D to let the printer know that the
% end of data has been reached and it can start calculating/printing.
% If this char is not sent, then the printer will sit there till it
% times out (could be a while).
%
% To print AZ_PROJ on a real Postscript printer,
% you concatenate all the files you want printed,
% with the controld.ps as the last file using an instruction like
%
% C:> copy az_ini.ps+az_proj.ps+grid.dat+n_amer.wdb+controld.ps big.ps
%
% You can then print big.ps on your real Postscript printer
%
% If you are sending big.ps to ghostcript, you do not need controld.ps
% If you have usd ghostscript in what I call postscript mode
% eg
%
% C:> type big.ps | gs - > c:\temp\error.out
%
% then the operating system will already have put an EOF 
% appropriate for the machine onto big.ps and you won't have
% to do anything special (ie controld.ps is not needed as
% part of big.ps).
