%Mountain file:
%File of mountain top locations for az_proj v1.1.3 or later
%new format for uniform location.
%
%(mountain file suggested by beta tester Paul Wade, N1BWT)
%
%This list is combined from information provided by
%Paul N1BWT and Zack Lau KH6CP/1 (zlau@arrl.org)
%and is of mountain tops and useful rover sites in New England, USA.
%Presumably after installation,
%this file would be called something like ne_usa.dat.
%
%If you have assembled a list of useful rover locations or mountain
%tops and wouldn't mind it being distributed with updates to
%az_proj, please send us your rover/mountain file. In the file
%please include your name (so that everyone will know who sent it in)
%and some information as to the locations described. Any other info, such as
%"road closed from Sept - May, contact Ranger at ph#... for more info"
%or "please close the gate as you leave" etc is very welcome.
%(Mountain tops aren't the only good spots to operate from... -
%I may have to change the designator "mountain" to something else :-)
%
%Mountains are located by 6 character grid square locators
%which run from AA00aa to RR99xx.
%The mountain symbol is put at the center of that square,
%giving an error (at the equator) in positioning of less
%than 2km in the E-W direction and less than 2km in the N-S direction.
%If greater accuracy is required, then the general purpose
%annot.dat file can provide locations to an arbitrary accuracy.
%
%use mountain: for default color (set black in az_ini.ps)
%use MOUNTAIN: for specical color (set red in az_ini.ps)
%
%To add a mountain to the map, supply data in the form

%or
%mountain:string_1:gridlocator:string_2:comment ignored by AZ_PROJ
%where
%mountain - data type
%string_1 - any or null string (blanks OK), will be written above mountain symbol
%			possible use - Mountain name
%location is gridsquare: or lat:lon:
%string_2 - any or null string (blanks OK), will be written below mountain symbol
%			possible use - Mountain elevation

MOUNTAIN:Mt. Washington:FN44ig::6288ft:
%
%Mt Kearsarge FN43BJ
%Great spot for working South, but blocked by Summit to the North.
%Summit is a short but slightly steep hike.  You can supposedly work
%W2SZ halfway up.  Summit is usually very windy.

%
%Mt Equinox VT FN33JC.
%Great spot but tough on cars. It is occupied with limited multis in June/Sept.
%KH6CP/1 shares the mountain with them then and is also there for the UHF
%contest. Trees are a problem--particularly when hidden by heavy fog.
%The inn/motel blocks shots to the East. In June, there is an auto race
%which severely limits access. Manchester gets clogged with tourists
%in the late summer/fall, possibly making driving tough for those in a hurry.

mountain:Mt. Ascutney:FN33sk::
mountain:Martha's Vineyard:FN41pi::
%
%Dennis Hill FN31JW Norfolk CT
%LOS to Greylock. Wauchusett, K2RIW (FN30HT), and Mt Equinox
%FN33JC are all workable on 10 GHz narrowband but not loud.
%Slow down as you approach Norfolk to avoid speed trap.
%There are steps to an observation area on top a stone building
%to clear trees. You may need a GPS or accurate speedometer
%to find the spot off Rt 272--don't expect any signs.

%
%Haystack FN32JA. A few miles up Rt 272. You can hike for about 10
%minutes to get to a stone observation tower. Possible for someone
%with handheld gear to cover 2 grids very easily from great spots.
mountain:Haystack:FN32JA::
%
%Hammonasset Beach FN31RF
%Nice spot to work South in the winter. Otherwise, you have to pay to get in.
%Expect lots of visitors year round.Well marked--easy to find.
mountain:Hammonasset Beach:FN31RF::
%
%Mohawk FN31IT.
%Nice spot for working due North/South. Last Sept. the little fire
%tower was trashed--missing steps and other important pieces.
%Poor shot NE. K2RIW is real loud. Marked, but partly hidden by sharp turns.
%Off Rt 4 about 4 miles past the rotary if you are heading west.
mountain:Mohawk:FN31IT::
%
%Pack Manadnock FN42BU.
%Overgrown with trees. You can walk to a picnic area to work South.
%WB1FKF in FN42JK is in one of the clear directions.

%Grand Manadnock FN32WS 3165 ft Elevation
%Scouting trip, July 24, 1994. About 1.5 hours to get to the summit.
%Warm weather at start, 1439Z (10:39 AM). Actually got to the summit
%at 1625Z despite spending about 15 minutes puzzling out the trail.
%1451Z--reach Spruce Link. 1 hour, 13 minutes to get down from the summit.
%Driving there (from Newington, CT) Rt 175 to 5/15 North.
%Then I-91 North to exit 3 to get on Rt 9 East.
%Take Rt 101 for roughly 12 miles. Big brown sign with yellow letters
%on right marks the access road--Jaffrey. 2 hours to get there.
%2 hrs 13 min to get to park gate. Distance 126.4 miles.
%Leaving Rt 9 onto 91. Drive straight (exit ramp on right goes to 91 North).
%Gate always open--can start hike at 4 AM and pay on the way out ($2.50).
%RF conditions/propagation. Excellent views of most of New England.
%LOS to most mountaintops (it blocks many paths!).
%No radio towers or power at the summit, which is above the tree line.
%Busy place, with lots of visitors on a clear day. 125,000 visitors a year.
%Open winters for those interested.

%Slide Mountain FN22TA/FN21TX
%165.8 mile trip via Rt 175/72/I84/I87/28/47 3.5 hours about the same via
%Rt 44/41/23/32/214/28/47 4.2 miles from Rt 28 to bridge 4.9 miles from
%bridge on Rt 47 to entrance.
%Summit 42 0.06N 74 23.10W (74.385/42.001) Close trees around need >10 foot

%Nice observation area toward the East 41 59.97N 74 23.05W (74.3842/41.9995)
%FN21TX. 50 to 70 degrees magnetic--close mountains in the way,
%70 to 180 degrees--clear--only distant mountains.
%People climb this one in the winter, just like Grand Manadnock.
