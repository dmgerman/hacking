
SETTING UP GHOSTSCRIPT

	For MSDOS machines, Ghostscript is available in 3 flavors, MSDOS
for 386 machines (fastest), Windows and DesqView X. Ghostscript is
freely available (with the GNU License) from ftp.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/ghost,
and from the GNU servers everywhere. The current (Jul '94) price for
Ghostscript on PC diskettes is U.S. $48 (incl S&H), payable by check
or money order to Aladdin Enterprises and mailed to:
		203 Santa Margarita Ave.
		Menlo Park, CA 94025

	The simplified procedure for installing the 386 version is -

1) Copy gs261386.zip, gs261ini.zip, az_proj.zip to a convenient directory,
say C:\gs261, then run pkunzip

	c:\gs261>pkunzip *

	producing a directory with about 7.5M of files. For ghostscript,
these will include the executable gs386.exe, the DOS extender dos4gw.exe,
various files used for gs261 startup and some .doc files. Some of the .ps
files are test images. They are alphabet.ps, cheq.ps, chess.ps, colorcir.ps,
escher.ps, golfer.ps, snowflak.ps, tiger.ps. Test one of them out
on your VGA display by

	c:\gs261>gs386 -q -- tiger.ps

	If the output has text, ghostscript will complain that the
required font files are missing and that it has substituted the font
"ugly", which comes with gs261ini.zip. Nicer fonts are available from
Aladdin with the Ghostscipt package and even nicer fonts are available
from Adobe.

	Next create a file to send to your printer. For a HP Color Desk
Jet 500 the instruction is

	c:\gs261>gs386 -q -sDEVICE=cdj550 -sOutputFile=tiger.cdj -- tiger.ps

	After several minutes and some disk activity an output file
tiger.cdj (about 1M) will be produced, which can be sent to the printer.
