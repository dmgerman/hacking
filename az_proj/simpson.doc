          UNDERSTANDING MARINE ELECTRONICS INTERFACING:
                    the Promise, the Problems

                by Wayne Simpson, Technical Editor
              International  Catalina 27 Association

     The  coming of the microprocessor to marine electronics  has
brought with it a promise and a curse. The promise is that two or
more  devices can share information and so become  more  valuable
and convenient to use. The curse is that not all marine  hardware
is compatible. To make matters worse, marine electronics manufac-
turers  often make it difficult for the consumer to tell  whether
any two devices will work together until bought and wired togeth-
er. Sometimes the result is a happy event. At other times, it can
be an exercise in frustration.
     An  interface is the boundary at which two independent  sys-
tems  communicate  and interact. When you  connect  an  interface
cable  from  your loran to your autopilot, the wire is  like  the
string between two cans in a play telephone. The wire carries the
conversation,  but it is the interfaces at each end that  do  the
talking.  If  the  two devices speak the same  language  and  can
understand the same words, then they can communicate.  Otherwise,
they can't. There is a standard for communications in the  marine
electronics  industry, and most manufacturers claim to  abide  by
it, at least in part. Unfortunately this is not always enough.


            NMEA 0183: The Marine Interface Standard

     In  1980, a group of professionals from the industry met  to
develop  a standard "language" for marine interfaces. The  result
was  the   National Marine Electronics  Association  (NMEA)  0180
standard.  It  addressed one problem, that of making  lorans  and
autopilots work together, and it was a success. In the  following
years this standard, revised, broadened, then totally revamped to
take  into  account the wide range of  electronics  appearing  on
boats,  led to the current NMEA 0183 standard used on almost  all
equipment today.
     The  NMEA 0183 standard calls for data communication in  the
form of coded "sentences." Each sentence begins with the  charac-
ter "$" and ends with a carriage return and line feed (<CR><LF>).
These  last two characters are "control" characters and  are  not
normally  printed  (for this reason they  are  customarily  shown
enclosed  in  brackets). Between the beginning and  end  of  each
sentence  are "fields" of data, each field separated by a  comma.
The  first  field in any sentence (field 0) begins with  the  two
letter talker mnemonic code ("talkers" are devices that send  out
information,  "listeners"  take  it in)  followed  by  the  three
letter code for the sentence. Data follows in the standard format
for that sentence. Here's an example:

      field #:    0     1     2   3      4
     sentence: $LCGLL,4001.74,N,07409.43,W<CR><LF>

     What is being said here? Lets look at it field by field. The
sentence  begins  with the start character "$."  Next  comes  the
talker identifier and sentence format code. LC stands for  Loran-
C,  GLL  for present position in Lat/Lon. Field  1  contains  the
set's  current  latitude. Field 2 is either N or S for  North  or
South. Field 3 is the set's current longitude. Field 4 is W or  E
for  West  or East. Thus, this sentence  reads  "Loran-C  present
position  in Lat/Lon: 40 degrees 1.74 minutes North,  74  degrees
9.43  minutes  West." A carriage return and line feed  close  the
sentence.  The GLL sentence is always displayed in  this  format.
Each  type of sentence, and there are many, has its own  specific
standard  format  (for a brief catalog of formats,  see  sidebar:
Deciphering the Code).
     Standard  sentences, each in a standard format. This is  how
NMEA  0183 is intended to work. But compliance with the  standard
is  voluntary. It is up to the manufacturers to decide  how  they
will implement the standard, and to what extent they will  comply
with  it. Because the standard is so broad, there is  often  more
than one way to express the same information, and this can  cause
problems.  There  are many different sentences, and  few  if  any
talker  devices say them all, or adhere strictly to the  standard
format of those they do. Does your autopilot need information  in
a form that your loran isn't sending out? How can you tell?
     Don't  count on there being an adequate explanation  in  the
manuals,  because often it isn't there. The owners manual for  my
loran  describes  the workings of the interface  this  way.  "The
extra connector on the rear panel is a serial data output  inter-
face which can provide loran data to an autopilot, track plotter,
or  fishfinder.  The serial data is in NMEA 0183  format  and  is
transmitted  continuously." That's it; the manual makes no  other
mention of the interface anywhere.  Other manuals I have seen are
about  as  descriptive.  In a follow-up bulletin  nearly  a  year
after  I  bought it the manufacturer of my loran  mentioned  what
sentences the data output sent (there were four) and what the pin
assignments  for  the  output connector were.  This  section  was
labeled "for techies only." These interfaces are touted in adver-
tising copy, but it's clear the manufacturers don't really expect
you to use them.  In the end, you probably will have to call  the
manufacturer for a proper explanation of their interface, and ask
specifically  whether  they have tested the devices you  have  in
mind for compatibility.
     So far we've discussed only software incompatibilities,  but
there can be physical ones, too. NMEA 0183 specifies no  standard
connector,  and  no two manufacturers seem to use the  same  one.
Usually, the owner will have to buy plugs from the  manufacturers
and make his own cable.


                         A Case History

     Two years ago, when I bought my West Marine Vector I  loran,
I  had no intentions of ever using the interface. Why  would  you
want to interface your electronics, anyway? Here's one example. A
loran can tell you where you are, what direction to steer to  get
to  your destination, and how far off your intended course  track
you are. By itself, however, it can't steer the boat. An  autopi-
lot  can steer, but on its  own can't compensate for currents  or
leeway.  An  autopilot interfaced with a loran can do  all  these
things,  and then some. Here's another example. The more you  use
the  magic  box, the more you realize the  information  it  gives
should  be displayed in the cockpit, where the helmsman can  have
instant access to it. But the cockpit can be a harsh location for
electronics  and  most lorans aren't truly  waterproof.  A  loran
"repeater,"  which echoes steering information on a  remote  dis-
play,  can  provide useful steering information  in  the  cockpit
while  leaving the loran below in the nav station, safe from  sun
and spray.
     An  integrated pilot/navigator system would have been  nice,
but  LEGACY, our 1977 Catalina 27, already had an  autopilot,  an
old  style  Autohelm 800. It worked perfectly well and  I  wasn't
going  to replace it just to have one with an interface. A  loran
repeater  would  be handy too, but those  available  commercially
cost as much as a second loran. I toyed with the idea of building
a repeater but in the end dismissed the whole thing as not  being
worth the time, effort, or cost.
     Two  things happened last summer that changed my opinion  on
interfacing. First, the old Autohelm failed, and the cost to  fix
it was almost as much as a new digital autopilot. I went for  the
new pilot,  settling on a Navico Tillerpilot 5000 largely because
Autohelm  had  changed their mounting dimensions and  would  have
required  me to change my setup. Navico's dimensions were  always
very  close the old Autohelm's, and would fit  without  modifica-
tions.
     The  new  pilot worked well all by itself, but  an  item  on
Navico's  option list caught my eye. It was a digital  hand  pro-
grammer  that made the TP5000 a much better pilot.  It  displayed
present  heading  from  the pilot's  internal  fluxgate  compass,
allowed you to make course changes in degrees rather than  beeps,
had an off-course alarm and let you program the pilot's  response
parameters  to better tune them to the boat and conditions.  Also
at  the time, if you bought a pilot and programmer and  sent  the
receipts  to Navico, they would send you the loran interface  box
(which normally cost's $150 at discount) for free.
     Second,  while  at a marine warehouse sale, I came across  a
KVH model LRX+ loran repeater. It was complete with the  warranty
card and instruction booklet. Its  price was $100, 1/3 the  usual
discount price. It was NMEA 0183 compatible, and so was my loran.
It even had a sheet with a listing of all the lorans the LRX+ had
successfully interfaced with. The Vector was there, right at  the
bottom of the list. Why not?
     I  took it down to my boat, hooked it up to the NMEA  inter-
face  on  the back of my loran, programmed a course to  a  nearby
buoy,  and waited for the repeater's display to come to life.  It
did,  and showed a bearing that was 12 degrees off! Something  in
the back of my mind reminded me that the magnetic variation in my
area  was 12 degrees. The repeater was displaying bearing in  de-
grees  true  rather than magnetic. Every time I wanted to  get  a
steering course off the display, I would have to do a calculation
in my head. The "curse" had visited me.
     I  was now in the position of having to figure out what  the
problem  was  with the repeater. I had no knowledge of  the  NMEA
standard or how it worked, so I called KVH. They said that  what-
ever the loran was sending out over the interface was reported on
the display. I called West Marine to find out what the Vector was
sending  out. They told me that both true and  magnetic  bearings
were  sent, and that it was up to the repeater  to  differentiate
between  them.  I asked KVH for more help, and  they  offered  to
upgrade the repeater's software to a newer version at no  charge.
I sent the repeater off to KVH Industries in Middletown, RI.
     While the repeater was away, I took a sample of the Vector's
data output using my PC. The procedure is described in the  side-
bar: Listening In, Speaking Out. Here's what I got:

      $LCGLL,4004.22,N,07409.78,W
      $LCBWC,,4001.80,N,07403.66,W,117,T,129,M,005.2,N,011
      $LCAPA,V,A,1.00,R,N,V,V,117,T,011
      $LCVTG,,,271,M,02.3,N,,

     The  pattern  of four sentences repeated  itself  every  two
seconds. Close inspection of this string revealed the problem. In
order  to work with a wide variety of lorans, the KVH  repeater's
program  accepts  data from several different sentences,  two  of
which,  BWC  (bearing  to waypoint along great  circle)  and  APA
(autopilot format A), appear in the above sample. Look closely at
the  APA  sentence. Data fields 8 and 9 display the  bearing  and
whether  it  represents degrees true or  magnetic.  The  standard
format for APA is degrees magnetic, in this example it is degrees
true. There was a bug in the Vector's software.
     Why  couldn't the repeater see that the bearing was  in  de-
grees  true and disregard it? Most of these programs  are  "comma
counters."  They  recognise a sentence of interest from  the  ad-
dress,  then  count commas until they get to the field  in  which
they expect to find data they need. They don't look at the fields
telling whether the information is true, magnetic, east, or west.
     The  people at KVH felt confident that the software  upgrade
would  cure  this condition but when the repeater came  back,  my
problem  was  still there. I called West. The problem  was  their
doing in the first place, maybe they would fix it.  Unfortunately
for  me,  the  Vector I was made obsolete by the  Vector  II  the
previous  year.  West planned no more software upgrades  for  the
Vector  I,  and it would be prohibitively expensive for  them  to
rewrite the software in response to this one complaint. I  could,
perhaps,  install  the Vector II software (which  corrected  this
bug) but then I would lose some of the features the Vector I  had
that the Vector II lacked. I decided it wasn't worth it.
     There was still some confusion over exactly what data fields
the repeater was looking at. To find out, I wrote a loran simula-
tor  program for my computer (see sidebar). I coded the  data  in
each  of the three fields that displayed bearing, giving  each  a
different  value,  and was able to prove that  the  repeater  was
looking at the APA sentence for its  bearing to display.
     Once again, I called KVH. Rob Solomon, one of KVH's  techni-
cal  people  who had stayed with me throughout this  ordeal,  was
certain  the  new software didn't look at APA  for  bearing.   He
wanted  to look further into the problem, but was unsure when  he
would  be able to find the time to do so. It was early  February,
war  had just broken out in the Persian Gulf and KVH was  in  the
midst  of  delivering 15,000 of its  DataScopes to  Desert  Storm
personnel. He promised to look at the LRX+'s software when things
quieted  down. Oddly enough, he called back in an hour  with  the
LRX+'s  program listing in hand. He told me absolutely  that  the
new software did not look at APA for bearing. Back to the drawing
board...
     I went home that night and ran my simulator again. There was
no  mistake.  I wrote a letter to Rob at KVH. In  it  I  included
everything  I  knew about the problem, a sample of  the  Vector's
data output, the listing of my simulator program, and the version
number  of the software EPROM ("Erasable Programmable  Read  Only
Memory,"  the  chip which stores the software)  installed  in  my
repeater.  I  sent it off by FAX the following day.  A  few  days
later,  I called Rob to see if he had gotten the letter. He  had,
but  had not yet read it. When he did, he saw that I hadn't  been
given the software he asked for. He sent a new EPROM chip in  the
mail (the right one, this time)  for me to put in myself. I  did,
and it worked as promised. My problem was solved, but only  after
five months had passed and I had spent many hours on testing  and
investigation.
     I had better luck regarding the autopilot. Late last summer,
wisened by my experience with the repeater (I had just begun  the
process  of sorting out its  troubles), I called West Marine  and
spoke  to  Dave  Wells, their technical support  person  for  the
Vector. I was determined to find out whether the  loran/autopilot
interface  would work before I bought it. He told me  the  Vector
and the Navico pilot were compatible. He had tested them himself.
I bought the programmer and sent away for the junction box.  When
it arrived, the manual informed me that my pilot would require  a
software upgrade from the factory in order to work properly  with
my loran (sound familiar?). It was by then late fall and I  would
not be needing the pilot for months, so I sent it off to Navico's
Largo,  FL plant. When it came back, I hooked the  loran,  pilot,
programmer  and  junction box together in my study  to  see  what
would  happen.  The system worked as advertised. This  time,  the
"promise" was fulfilled.


                 Conclusions and Recommendations

     My story has a happy ending. Come spring, I will be install-
ing my new toys and enjoying them all summer. Others who try this
may  not be so fortunate. The NMEA system can work, but there  is
no  guarantee  in any particular case that it will.  My  repeater
adventure  shows what sort of problems you can have, and to  what
lengths you may have to go in order to solve them.
     My  recommendations are these: Do your homework  before  you
buy. If you are buying from a supplier who will do the  installa-
tion for you, make sure he will guarantee the satisfactory opera-
tion of the interface. If you will do the installation  yourself,
try  to arrange for a full credit return in the event the  inter-
faces  prove to be incompatible. Call the manufacturers  and  ask
questions. Take the time to understand what the NMEA 0183  stand-
ard is and how it works.
     If  you find that you've been stuck anyway all is  not  com-
pletely lost. A company called Maricom Electronics, at 2911 River
Drive, Thunderbolt, GA 31404 (phone (912) 354-4542) markets  what
it  calls  a "Universal Marine Interface." For just  under  $400,
this box claims to take data in any format that any talker  might
emit and put it into a form any listener will understand. In  the
absence of less extreme solutions, this may be worth trying.

SIDEBAR A:
                 NMEA 0183: DECIPHERING THE CODE

     The  "language" of NMEA 0183 is extensive but not  difficult
to  understand.  The  ground rules are  these:  maximum  sentence
length is 80 characters including the starting "$," the terminat-
ing  <CR><LF>, and everything in between. Minimum number of  data
fields is two, including the address field (talker identifier and
sentence format). If data for any field is unavailable, a  "null"
field,  two commas with nothing between them (",,") can  be  sent
instead.
     Here  is a sampling of two letter talker  identifier  codes.
There are others, for everything from satellite communications to
atomic  clocks,  but these are some of the most familiar  to  the
recreational  sailor.

  LC   Loran-C
  GP   GPS
  TR   Transit SATNAV
  AP   Autopilot (magnetic)
  HC   Magnetic heading compass
  RA   Radar
  SD   Depth sounder
  VW   Mechanical speed log

     Now  for  some of the more common sentences  that  might  be
spoken  by  your LORAN, SATNAV, or GPS. This is  not  a  complete
listing,  but  should  illustrate how the system  works.  In  the
following  examples,  the character "#" will denote  some  number
(0-9). Remember that each of these sentences would be preceded by
the  start character "$" and the two letter talker ID. Each  also
would be followed by the sentence terminator, <CR><LF>.

Sidebar B:
                   LISTENING IN, SPEAKING OUT:
     Using your Home Computer to Monitor NMEA Communications

     The data that comes out of your loran or other NMEA equipped
gear  is in the same format as that from your personal  computer.
It is possible, and very easy to take a look at what your talkers
are  saying,  and to speak to your listeners in a form  they  can
understand.
     To listen in, you need a PC equipped with a serial  (RS-232)
interface and modem program (such as HAYES SmartCom or CTRM).  If
your  program has a data capture feature, you can read data  from
the line into a file for later use.
     To  make the connection, connect the NMEA signal line  (line
A,  output, etc) to the RS-232 "receive data" line (#2 on  9  pin
or  #3 on 25 pin connectors), and the NMEA ground line  (line  B,
return, etc) to the RS-232 "signal ground" (#5 on 9 pin or #7  on
25 pin connectors).
     The  statistics for NMEA 0183 are as follows: 4800  baud,  8
data  bits,  1 stop bit, no parity. Set your  modem  program  for
these  parameters. Switch on your loran (or other talker),  start
the modem program, and the data should come pouring in.
     One  note  of caution regarding  radionavigation  receivers:
they are very sensitive to the kind of RF interference computers,
fluorescent  lights, TV's and other such things cause.  Your  re-
ceiver may not be able to lock on to its  transmitters with these
things operating nearby, and you may have to set up the  receiver
in  another room and connect it with a long cable for it to  work
properly.
     Speaking to your listeners is only slightly more  complicat-
ed.  You need to send the data strings over and over again  at  a
repetition  rate  of once every few seconds (but no  faster  than
once  every second). For this, I wrote a short simulator  program
in BASIC that does the job, and allows me to program in the  text
I want to send. The connection is different, also. This time  you
will  have  to connect the NMEA signal line to  RS-232  "transmit
data"  (#3 on 9 pin or #2 on 25 pin connectors), and NMEA  ground
to  RS-232 signal ground (as before). In addition,  you  probably
will have to bring the RS-232 "data set ready" (DSR) terminal  to
a  low  voltage. You can do this by inserting  a  jumper  between
"data  terminal  ready" (DTR, normally #4 on 9 pin or #20  on  25
pin) and DSR (#6 on 9 or 25 pin setups).

interface problems this way.
