
INSTALLATION OF AZ_PROJ

	This installation procedure assumes you are
using a DOS machine and are using Ghostscript to output
to your display and to a non-postscript printer. No 
installation is neccessary for a Postscript printer.

	1. Copy the AZ_PROJ zip file and the Ghostscript 
zip files to the directory of your choice (eg az_proj). 

	2. Run the install.bat file (contained in the 
azprjxxx.zip file). This unzips the zip files and puts the 
files into the correct subdirectories.

	3. Check that Ghostscript works on your machine by
running the test batch files suggested by the install program.
One of these tests Ghostscript in graphics mode and the other 
tests Ghostscript in text mode. Do not even think about trying 
AZ_PROJ until Ghostscript can pass these two tests. 

	3. Run the example .bat files contained in the AZ_PROJ package
These will produce some standard maps centered on the ARRL HQ, in CT, USA.

	4. If everything works so far, then you can customise the
maps to your QTH, by editing az_ini.ps and various data files 
to customise the maps for you.
