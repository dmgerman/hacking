Announcement: AZ_PROJ v1.04 Azimuthal Equidistant Postscript Mapping package
available from the AZ_PROJ Map Server Website at

http://www.xray.duke.edu:1080/

or by ftp

ftp://ftp.xray.duke.edu/pub/az_proj

	The file is  azprj104.zip (approx 1.2M).

	The new features are

	1. Orthographic orientation option
(The Orthographic projection puts South at the top of the
page). Needed for people in the Southern Hemisphere (-:

	2. ARRL grid square labelling style added. The ARRL
style has much smaller labels for the grid squares and puts
the letter square labels in the bottom left of the square.
The grid square labelling style used in v1.00-v1.03 is
now called az_proj style.

	3. Several different options added for shading
worked grid squares (different colors, different cross
hatching methods) so that it's possible to mark grid
squares worked by two (or more) different people. See
the sample grid.dat file for more info. You can also use
the same options for marking the grids at the ends of a
qso (see qso.dat for examples).

	4. Plotting TV stations for North America (NA)
and Europe. A full list of NA stations broadcast
stations (MW, FM, TV) in machine readable format has been
produced by Colin K4SSO. A separate file consisting of
only the NA Channel 2 stations (55.25MHz useful as 6m
propagation markers) has been added. A list of European
TV stations (from Geoff Brown and Emil W3EP) has been
converted to machine readable format, for 6m propagation
markers.

	5. DAT file formats are still changing (sorry).
Anything which is a transmitter (TV station, rover, beacon,
repeater) all have the same format. The only thing which
changes is the symbol displayed. Please note the changes
detailed in each .DAT file (at most you will have to add
an extra colon or two to your old files if you want to update
them).

	6. GRID2.DAT file format of v1.03 is now standard
(and called the GRID format, with no 2). The old format from
v1.00 which had been used in parallel, has been
dropped.

	7. An install.bat file has been added to install
AZ_PROJ and Ghoscript onto a DOS machine with a VGA or
SVGA monitor. Sample batch files for testing both Ghostscript
and AZ_PROJ are included.


	8. Easier method for choosing when to draw grid square
borders and compass (in az_ini.ps). (Also clearer explanation
of what's happening, I hope).

	9. Display of USA by call areas (0..9) rather than
(or as well as) by states.

	10. Labelling feature. The center of the line on which
the label sits, is at the lat/lon (cf annotations where a blob
is at the lat/lon). This feature can be used for labelling
continents, countries... The size of the characters can be
chosen differently for each entry, and the size chosen scales
with the map scale. You can try this feature out, by labelling
the US call areas with the file us_call.dat when the numbers
0..9 will be drawn in each call area. The borders of the call
areas can be drawn by turning on /draw_USA_call_areas in
az_ini.ps.

General blurb about AZ_PROJ

	AZ_PROJ is a collection of postscript files and data
files for generating azimuthal equidistance projections of the earth
from (almost) any point on earth. It can plot color maps of the
surface of the earth on any scale, draw and/or label grid squares,
show worked grid squares on a band(s) of your choice, dxcc
countries (and countries worked an a particular mode, eg CW/SSB),
mountain tops, rovers, repeaters, beacons and can use NMEA input
from a GPS receiver to center the map.

	AZ_PROJ can be run on ANY computer (Mac, PC/DOS/Win/DVX, Unix)
and output to a postscript device (printer, ghostscript runing on a
unix or DOS machine with a  ghostscript compatible printer, eg
HPcolor inkjets). Ghostscript will also allow display of the maps
on screens.

	Although a rudimentary understanding of postscript will
help in running AZ_PROJ, sample .bat files are supplied to make
initial maps and it should be possible to make simple changes to
the az_ini.ps and *.bat files to get the maps you want.

	To display the maps on a screen or to use a
non-postscript printer, you should first obtain ghostscript
(available for PC (DOS, Win, DesqViewX) or Unix) from your
favorite ftp site (try ftp.cs.wisc.edu/pub/ghost)

	The AZ_PROJ files are GNU copylefted.
