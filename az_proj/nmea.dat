% nmea.dat file for az_proj
% File for NMEA (National Marine Electronics Assoc) 0183 standard codes
%
% allows entering of QTH lat/lon co-ordinates from external devices
% such as GPS receivers, rather than having to enter the data
% into az_ini.ps with an editor.
% This feature was suggested by Paul N1BWT for use by moutain toppers.
%
% only GLL (Geog Lat/Lon)
% and BWC (bearing to waypoint along Great Circle) are implemented
%
% The file consists of any number of lines of NMEA codes which could
% in principle be captured from a GPS receiver on the serial port
% by a program like kermit.
%
% For those of you who have azimuth indicators, wind speed and
% direction indicators, thermometers, hygrometers, etc, hooked
% up to your computer, so that they can output a line of data to
% a file, then presumably this information can be drawn with az_proj as well.
%
% I don't have a GPS receiver to test this.
% I got the specs from Paul Wade N1BWT, who
% sent me an article by Wayne Simpson (wms@spin.ho.att.com)
% and from Mike Owen W9IP. Thanks to Jim KC7MJ for a lead to a WWW site
% Let me know if it works (or doesn't work) -JM
%
% The full NMEA specs are available from
% NMEA, PO Box 50040, Mobile, AL, 36605, USA, (205)-473-1793.
% (This is more than you'll ever want to know, 
% instead read Wayne Simpson's article, simpson.doc 
% included with this package by kind permission of Wayne.)
%
% The NMEA device will send 4800,N,1 packets down your serial line
% which you can capture with some program like kermit. You'll get
% (I think) 1-5 lines repeated about every 2 secs.
% Possible lines as they will come down your serial line
% (#'s are digits that I haven't figured out what they do,
% - I don't parse them)
% the data line is recognised by the string ($GP) at the start
% of the line and a comma anywhere else in the line
%
% If you're going to be using nmea data, then be careful
% if you have center_offset on. Az_proj calculates the
% bearing/distance from the QTH to the new center and
% then translates the map by this amount for all subsequent
% calculations. If you then read in the nmea.dat file
% changing the QTH, the actual (offset) center will be displaced
% by the distance between the QTH in az_ini.ps and in nmea.dat.
% If this distance is small on the scale of the map, then you
% probably will not notice anything. If the distance is large
% then the projection will still be correct (from the nmea.dat QTH)
% but the center of the map won't be where you asked it to be.
%
% The lat/lon of the QTH in az_ini.ps is overwritten by the nmea.dat data
% However the QTH_name is not (it's written out onto the Title
% before this file is read). So change it manually yourself
% to something like (mountain top).
%
% The time (hour/min) in az_ini.ps is overwritten by BWC,
% giving the correct lon for the sun.
% However there is no date info from GPS
% and the date is not overwritten.
% the date must be entered in az_ini.ps
% to give the correct latitude for the sun
