% Most of the AZ_PROJ customisable variables are in az_ini.ps 
% (a relatively large file). If you routinely only vary a
% small number of variables, they can be separated into a smaller
% file which is read in after az_ini.ps, thus overwriting the
% standard values in az_ini.ps. Alternatively, if you routinely
% make several different maps, then a separate config file can be
% made for each map.
%
% Thus an HF config file could have a large scale map,
% lat/lon lines separated by 30 degrees, with rivers and
% state borders turned off.
%
% A config file would have a scale suitable for the
% band, grid squares and all geographic features turned on.
%
% A config file for a mountain top, will have a different QTH 
% than your normal home.
%
% a config file can be used with ghostscript
% C:>gs az_ini.ps config.ps -- az_proj.ps world.wdb dxcc.dat
%
% or by making a big.ps file eg for HF
% C:>copy az_ini.ps+config.ps+az_proj.ps+world.wdb+dxcc.dat big.ps
%
% for a mountain top expedition on 10GHz using a GPS receiver to determine
% your QTH
%
%C: gs -q az_ini.ps 10ghconf.ps -- az_proj.ps nmea.dat mountain.dat rover.dat n_amer.wdb
%
% where 10ghconf.ps has the scale variable set for 10GHz (say 25km/cm)
% nmea.dat has the QTH
% rover.dat is the rovers out that weekend
% mountain.dat is the list of mountains (and other sites where people operate)
