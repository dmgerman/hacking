* Welcome to org-annotation-helper

This package will allow you to invoke remember within emacs with an
org link to the current URL, including its title, and the currently
highlighted text.

It works by creating a javascript "boorkmarklet" that gets added to
the bookmarks bar of your Web browser (such as Firefox). The
bookmarket converts your current URL, its title and hightlighted text
into another URI that starts with remember:// (invoke remember) or
annotation:// (create an org-link to the current document).

These two new protocols (remember:// and annotation://) are "handled"
by an external application, in this case a small shell script called
org-annotation-helper. org-annotation-helper invokes emacsclient to
communicate with your running emacs.

It might sound cumbersome, but once the installation is completed all
pieces work seamlessly. You click on the bookmarklet and you emacs
reacts to your request either by creating a remember buffer, or by
storing the current URL as an org-link.
