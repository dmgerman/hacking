  // Comments are not allowed in .json files 
  // But it's useful to keep comments within your json files before they go in the wind
  // 
  // So here is what I did
  // 1. Install node and npm
  // 2. Install mjson like this:  npm install -g mjson
  //
  // Then each time the manifest-with comments is modified:
  // $ mjson.js -f -s manifest-with-comments.txt -o manifest.json

  // Here it's the version of this extension. Must be incremented each time the extension is uploaded to Webstore
  // HISTORY: 
  // v1 to v9 don't really exist, but should be considered as the work from aboodman
  // v10 was the first uploaded to Chrome's Webstore but didn't worked because the extensino hat to be ported to manifest_version 2
  // v11 is the missing element
  // v12 was the first version that worked more or less with manifest_version 2, but only locally
  // v13 aimed to fix a very annoying bug that prevented to upload it to chromestore : « The manifest must define a version »
  // v14 "Comments are not allowed in JSON. Oh my..."
  // v15 Merge a patch from François Beaufort. Thanks !
