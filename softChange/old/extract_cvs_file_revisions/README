do.sh can do all of this at once
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Create schema

  * First extract files for each revision and put them into the database (populate-revisions.pl)

  * Extend fileRevisions with its cleanLOCS (add-clean-locs-to-filesrevisions.pl)

* Now create a table called Definitions

   * Populate it with info from filesRevision (add-definitions.pl)

   * Extend it with the length of the defintion  (add-length-of-definition.pl)


Other programs

  - extract_revisions.pl (given a filename, and revision, prints to the STDOUT)

  - compute difference revisions
