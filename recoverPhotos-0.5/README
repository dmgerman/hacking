This program recovers JPG and Canon CR2 files from camera media (such
as flashcards).

WARNING

This program relies on the fact that most photos are composed of
contiguous sectors. If you tend to delete a lot of photos before a
format, then you might not have very good success. But if you are like
me: who reformats every time) then you fill get most of your pictures
back.

This program has only been tested with a 20d. Any success stories are
welcome.


INSTALLATION

./configure 
make
make install


HOW TO USE

To run this program I recommend you first copy the contents of the
card to a file in your machine. The easiest way is to use the dd
command.

Instructions:

* Connect the camera or the flashcard to the computer.

* Check what is the mount point for your camera or the flashcard. You
  can use the mount command for this. For example in my computer the
flashcard is mounted as device /dev/sdc1


dmg@platinum recoverPhotos]$ mount
[...]
/dev/sdc1 on /media/EOS_DIGITAL type vfat ...
[...]

Now, use dd to copy the flashcard to a file. For example, this command
copies the contents of my memory card to a file called /tmp/card.bytes
(You might need to run this command as root).

dd if=/dev/sdc1 of=/tmp/card.bytes

Make sure the device name (in this case /dev/sdc1) is correct! 

The resulting file should have the same size as the flashcard.


./recoverPhotos /tmp/card.bytes

and check the output. Hopefully you will have a bunch of photos in the
current directory. Run the program without parameters to see all the
options available.

CANON USERS

If you use a camera that uses the custom function "Add Decision Data"
(CF18 in the D20), and you are 100% sure it was on when you took the
photos, then make sure you specify the --canonADD option. The option
is not critical (it is not part of the photo), but the data is there
if you want to recover it.
